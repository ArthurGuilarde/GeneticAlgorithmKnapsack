# GeneticAlgorithmKnapsack
This project is developh to solve the Knapsack problem using the intuition of GeneticAlgorithm.
 
 ## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
I recomend you use Anaconda or Miniconda package, but only you need install on your system is:
* Python
* Numpy

### How its work?
You only need run the file named "main.py". Remember to make sure them all packages stay one same folder.
Inside the "main.py" file will see this varibales:
* cross_rate
  * Percent no enable crossover fase.
* mutation_rate
  * Percent no enable mutation fase.
* max_generations
  * Define the loops of evolution.
* max_pop
  * Define the max number of single loop (generation).
* limiter
  * Limiter of values_choices (weight in knapsack).
* values_choices
  * Weight of ever possyble choice.
* reward_choices
  * Reward of ever possyble choice.
